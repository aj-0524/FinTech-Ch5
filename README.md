# ***Finanical Health Evaluation Tool***

The purpose of the financial health evaluation tool is to help members within a credit union evaluate their financial health. To be more specific, this tool allows the credit union members assess their monthly budgets and then use this information to forecast an effective retirement plan using their holdings (ex. cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds).

## **Required Technologies**

In order to run the application, you first must install three Python libraries; 'requests', 'json', and 'alpaca-trade-api'.  

`requests` - The 'requests' library helps you access data via APIs.  

`json` - The 'json' library puts the API response into a readable format.  

`alpaca-trade-api` - The 'alpaca-trade-api' library allows you to interact with the Alpaca API via its functions.

In addition to the above, you will also need to utilize your Alpaca keys which you can receive by signing up [here](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup?amp_device_id=ZuWbGLD2dVtVVAB1FUjRFQ).
